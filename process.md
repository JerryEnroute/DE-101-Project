# Process description

### 1. Data Ingestion:

**a. Set Up Environment:**
- Ensure that `nikescrapi.py` file is accessible and can be executed.
- Install necessary libraries and dependencies, if they aren't installed yet.

**b. Data Extraction:**
- Execute `nikescrapi.py` to consume data from the Nike API. 
- Ensure the API call is successful and verify data extraction by reviewing the first few rows of the `products` and `sales` data files.

### 2. Data Processing:

**a. Data Cleaning & Transformation with Airflow:**
- Set up Airflow if not already configured.
- Create an Airflow DAG to manage the ETL process.
- Add tasks to read data from the generated `products` and `sales` files.
- Transform data to a consistent format (e.g., date formats, currency formats).
- Handle any missing or null values, duplicate records, and outliers.
- Aggregate data if necessary (sum sales, average ratings, etc.).

### 3. Data Ingestion into Data Warehouse:

**a. Setup Snowflake Environment:**
- Create an account or access the Snowflake environment.
- Configure Snowflake to allow data ingestion (e.g., create a new database, set up permissions).

**b. Ingest Data into Snowflake using Airflow:**
- Within your Airflow DAG, add tasks to push the processed data to Snowflake.
- Use Snowflake Python connectors or any other relevant tool to connect to Snowflake and push data.

### 4. Data Warehouse Structure:

**a. Design Schema in Snowflake:**
- Based on the structure of the `products` and `sales` data, design the Snowflake schema (star schema or snowflake schema as per the use-case).
- Create tables in Snowflake with the appropriate column data types.

**b. Data Validation:**
- After ingesting data into Snowflake, validate data by checking record counts between source files and Snowflake tables.
- Run sample queries to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

### 5. Querying the Datawarehouse:

**a. Setup Tableau Environment:**
- Install Tableau Desktop or connect to Tableau Server.
- Set up a connection between Tableau and Snowflake.

**b. Design Reports in Tableau:**
- Based on your business requirements, design visual reports in Tableau using data from Snowflake.
- For instance, you can create visuals like sales trends over time, top-rated products, bestsellers, etc.

**c. Validation & Optimization:**
- Ensure the designed reports are providing accurate data.
- Optimize queries if required for faster performance.

### 6. Final Steps:

**a. Documentation:**
- Document the entire process, from data extraction to report generation. Include schema diagrams, ETL flow, and any challenges faced.

**b. Review:**
- Conduct a review with stakeholders to demonstrate the ETL process and the reports generated in Tableau.

**c. Schedule & Monitoring:**
- If this ETL process is recurrent, schedule the Airflow DAG to run at specified intervals.
- Monitor the ETL jobs for any failures or discrepancies. Set up alerts for any job failures.

**d. Backup & Recovery:**
- Ensure that the Snowflake data warehouse has a backup strategy in place. Consider periodic snapshots or other backup mechanisms.
- Have a recovery plan in case of any data loss or failures.

Remember, throughout each phase, it's essential to maintain open communication with stakeholders and test each step to ensure accuracy and reliability. Good luck with your project!
